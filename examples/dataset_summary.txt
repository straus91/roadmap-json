The dataset used in the study comprises 125 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with pemetrexed-based platinum doublet chemotherapy at Cleveland Clinic. The dataset is based on non-contrast-enhanced CT images from these patients. Imaging details such as resolution and specific imaging parameters were not stated, but the section thickness varied from 1 to 5 mm. The file format used for the CT scans is not specified, nor is there information about whether these files contained private health information.

Instances in this dataset relate to each other as there may be multiple CT images per patient depending on the sectioning of scans, but each patient was included as a single instance in the dataset based on their treatment outcomes (responder or non-responder). The dataset was divided into a training set with 53 patients and a validation set with 72 patients, ensuring an equal number of responders and non-responders within the training set.

Missing information was addressed by excluding patients who did not have available CT images (within 30 days before chemotherapy), lacked response data after four cycles of chemotherapy, or did not meet certain inclusion criteria for response classification. This resulted in the exclusion of 53 patients whose CT scans couldn't be located or were inadequate and further excluding 65 patients who lacked response data or did not meet inclusion criteria.

Pre-processing steps included annotation of the index lesion on CT images by three experienced radiologists, ensuring inter-reader reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for feature stability and reproducibility. The dataset's primary motivation was to predict chemotherapy response and outcomes such as time to progression and overall survival in NSCLC patients using radiomic features extracted from CT scans. 

The dataset availability and the specifics regarding its access or licensing were not mentioned. It was used retrospectively under an IRB-approved protocol, and patient consent was waived, implying adherence to privacy standards, though explicit steps taken to protect health information were not detailed.
